Nagios Vim Syntax
=================

Syntax file for Nagios in Vim. Forked from the [`vim-scripts` repository][1] of
the same name, itself a mirror from [the script][2] on the official Vim site.

This way I can add it as a Pathogen bundle and submodule of my [dotfiles][3]
repository.

This was originally forked to include `ftdetect` rules, which are missing from
the original repository. They're for the default install going into
`/usr/local/nagios`, or the Debian layout of `/etc/nagios3`. I'm happy to merge
others in if this is at all helpful to anyone.

I may add or fix more stuff later, which I'll push back to the original.

the maintainer, one Elan Ruusam√§e. This particular fork is by [Tom Ryder][4].
